discretetime
============

A simple experiment in time tracking that works by letting you sample
what you are up to at specified time intervals.

It pops up every 15 minutes, and asks you what you're doing. You can
type notes, and any word that starts with : is a tag. The notes go to
a CSV file that can be used from e.g. Excel to tally up summaries of
how you were spending your time.

The idea is that no-one really has the discipline to log their work
accurately anyway, and being reminded in a non-irritating and useful
way helps. Merely sample what you're doing is less intrusive and in
aggregate, more accurate. If you were away from your computer, you'll
just log it when you get back.

Suggestions for use:
--------------------

Have a simple set of tags for the actual activity, e.g. coding
(:code), designing (:dsn), debugging (:dbg), documenting (:doc),
planning (:plan), meeting (:mt), talking (:talk), support call
(:spt)...

Have another set for different projects or customers e.g. :tax :ibm
:apple :ms :break :lunch

Each timed note would then normally have two tags and if you want,
something human readable.

If you took a coffee break, then that would be in there too.

What to do with this data? I don't know exactly yet, but it should at
least be interesting to see how much time I really spend doing what I
think I should be doing. :)
